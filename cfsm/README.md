## `pmontepagano/search/cfsm` is a CFSMs library in Go.

This library was forked from [`nickng/cfsm`](https://github.com/nickng/cfsm).

Communicating Finite State Machines (CFSMs) or Communicating Automata are
formalisims for modelling concurrent processes by Brand and Zafiropulo (1983).

This is an implementation of CFSMs in Go for generating input petri nets for
[petrify](http://www.cs.upc.edu/~jordicf/petrify/), used in
[Synthesising choreographies](http://mrg.doc.ic.ac.uk/publications/from-communicating-machines-to-graphical-choreographies/).
